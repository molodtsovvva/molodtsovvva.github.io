        <p>I am a third-year student at <a href="https://www.oberlin.edu/" rel="external">Oberlin 
            College</a>  studying Physics and Computer Science. I am interested in technology, fundamental science, and engineering,
             and I am currently engaged in undergraduate research in Atomic Physics. Besides my commitment to my studies,
              I like to play and produce music, create coding projects, and be involved in volunteer work, making a social impact.

            <h2 id="academics">Academics</h2>
            <p>I am currently pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Physics and Computer Science at Oberlin College. 
                I am a part of Prof. Jason <a href="https://www2.oberlin.edu/faculty/jstalnak/Research.html" rel="external">Stalnaker's lab</a>, 
                working on undergraduate atomic physics research focusing 
                on optical magnetometry based on atomic vapor cells. Within my research, I am developing the nuclear 
                spin oscillator as a part of the Global Network of Optical Magnetometers for Exotic physics (GNOME). 
                This network of optical magnetometers is looking for dark matter in the form of large-scale cosmological 
                structures composed of ultra-light axion-like fields. You can find more information regarding the
                 collaboration on the <a href="https://budker.uni-mainz.de/gnome/" rel="external">GNOME Website</a>. </p>
                 <p>I am passionate about sharing knowledge. During the Fall Semester of 2023, I co-authored and co-taught the Experimental College <a href="https://www.oberlinexco.org/" rel ="external">(ExCo)</a> semester-long course "UkraineCo," providing students, 
                    faculty, and members of the Oberlin community with a for-credit course focused on Ukrainian history and culture. I facilitated classes for groups ranging from 10 to 15 participants,
                     engaging with readings, art, films, and guest speakers to provide context for Ukrainian history, heritage, and society.
                      This way, I tried to address the issue of underrepresented Ukrainian studies in American college curricula.</p>

            <h2 id="music" class="music-title"><a href="music.html">Music</a></h2>
            <p>Over the past few years, I’ve been enjoying making and playing music. Even though I consider guitar to be my main instrument,
                 I like picking up various other instruments.
                 I enjoy collaborating with other musicians and have tons of fun jamming with my friends. </p>
            <p>In addition, I am passionate about music recording and signal processing. I like learning about recording techniques
                 and working with both analog and digital audio gear. 
                I enjoy working with audio effects, which resulted in me creating a computer application simulating the usage of effect pedals 
                (which you can find  <a href="#pedalboard-playground">here</a>!)</p>
            <p>Moreover, I am keen on producing, mixing, mastering music, and working with different DAWs and digital 
                modular synthesizers. </p>
                <p>You can find and stream my music <a href="music.html">here</a>! All of it is written, performed, produced, mixed, and mastered by me.</p>

            <h2 id="coding-projects">Coding Projects</h2>
            I like using my computer science skills to come up with solutions for different technical problems and developing software 
            I’m interested in. I use programming in the scope of my physics research, writing code mainly in Mathematica, IgorPro and 
            LabView. There, I focus on data representation, building qualifying transforms, and also on automating the experiments. 
            Outside research, I prefer coding in Rust and Python, but also have a vast familiarity with other programming languages.
             As for now, my skillset also includes C#, Java, Racket, and Bash. 


            <h4 id="pedalboard-playground"><a href="pedals.html">"Pedalboard Playground"</a></h4>
            <p>Together with <a href="https://github.com/benthebenno" rel = "external">Ben Rappoport</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Sergey-ASP" rel = "external">Alec Sabol-Pulling</a>, I developed and programmed the "Pedalboard Playground" application 
                for music learners and enthusiasts. The application enables users to construct custom virtual boards of effects pedals,
                 applying diverse audio effects to uploaded sounds. "Pedalboard Playground" facilitates a learning environment, allowing 
                 users to gain proficiency in digital pedal usage, laying the groundwork for understanding analog audio effects and getting
                  familiar with the signal processing foundations. It provides a cost-effective sound-editing solution by offering 10 distinct
                   digital audio effects, eliminating the need to purchase expensive analog effect pedals. You can find
                    "Pedalboard Playground" <a href="pedals.html">here</a>!

            <h2 id="volunteering">Volunteering</h2>
            <p>Being born and raised in Kyiv, Ukraine, the unprovoked russian full-scale invasion of my country has upended 
                the lives of many people I care about. For that reason, I focus a lot of my volunteering efforts on war relief.
                 Over the past years, I’ve been active as a fundraiser, demonstration, and charity fair organizer in collaboration 
                 with Ukrainisches Koordinationszentrum Dresden in Germany. I was a communicator for Ukrainian refugee children 
                 at Elyria Westwood Middle School, acting as a liaison between the kids and the school counselors. I helped organize 
                 a benefit Oberlin Conservatory artists concert, raising donations for the “Razom for Ukraine” charity foundation. 
                 Additionally, I organized a vigil and a fundraiser on the college campus as a part of the “American Students Stand With Ukraine”<sup><a href="https://evergreen.humanitru.com/web/campaigns/razom~support-for-ukraine?tab_2014=id%3A4867" rel="external" id="ref1">&#8599;</a></sup> 
                 campaign, collectively raising over $8,000 in donations allocated for purchasing power generators for Ukrainian hospitals. Over the month of 
                 January 2024, I volunteered for the <a href="https://www.razomforukraine.org//" rel="external">"Razom for Ukraine"</a> non-profit organization, 
                 focusing on creating BPMN notation for logistic processes for their further automation, more efficient resource distribution,
                  and transparent responsibility allocation.
